This is Logdoc, a tool for managing log messages for Java code, in a contract-
first manner. 

This software is available under the terms of a BSD-style license, see
the accompanied COPYRIGHT file.


EXAMPLE

Example Logdoc log.xml file:

   <log since="MyLibrary 5.5.3" domain="com.znerd.mylibrary" public="true">
      <translation-bundle locale="en_US" />
      <group id="transactions" name="Transactions">
         <entry id="102" level="NOTICE">
            <description>Transaction starting.</description>
            <param name="id"          type="int32" nullable="false"  />
            <param name="description" type="text"  nullable="true"  />
         </entry>
         <entry id="103" level="INFO">
            <description>Transaction fully started.</description>
            <param name="id" type="int32" nullable="false"  />
         </entry>
      </group>
   </log>

For more examples, see src/unittests/input/.

Input files can be translated to Java and HTML code using Ant tasks. Define it
in your Ant build.xml file as follows:

   <taskdef resource="org/znerd/logdoc/ant/antlib.xml" classpath="lib/logdoc.jar" />

Then the tasks can be used as follows:

   <logdoc-code in="src/logdoc" out="src/java" />
   <logdoc-html in="src/logdoc" out="build/logdoc-htdocs" />


BUILDING LOGDOC

To build Logdoc self, use Ant 1.7.1 (1.8.0 may also work) and execute:

   ant

Under the target/ directory files will be generated, including a JAR file and
Javadoc API documentation.

Note: The build process is currently being migrated from Ant to Maven, this is
      work in progress.


HISTORY

Logdoc used to be part of XINS, see:

   http://xins.sourceforge.net/

It has been factored out of XINS by me.
